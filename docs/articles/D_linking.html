<p>The purpose of this vignette is to provide details on how FHIR documents are transformed to graphs in BiocFHIR.</p>
<p>This text uses R commands that will work for an R (version 4.2 or greater) in which BiocFHIR (version 0.0.14 or greater) has been installed. The source codes are always available at <a href="https://github.com/vjcitn/BiocFHIR">github</a> and may be available for installation by other means.</p>

<p>We made a new S3 class to hold the graph with some convenient metadata. Ultimately that metadata should be bound into the graph itself as nodeData and edgeData components.</p>
<p>Because basic identifying information is decomposed into components in FHIR, we have a utility to acquire the patient name for a given bundle.</p>

<p>This collection of vignettes shows some approaches to working with FHIR R4 JSON using R. It is very likely that a new collection of bundles obtained from a different source would not be properly ingested or transformed by the code present in this version of BiocFHIR. Future extensions of the package will employ direct analysis of JSON structures to identify data values and relationships, that should be more adaptable to diverse collections of documents.</p>
<p>Relationships among resources may be represented in many different ways. This survey of the resources in the synthea bundles is surely limited, perhaps even with respect to the information available in the bundles. FHIR experts are invited to identify gaps in this implementation. We anticipate considerable additional work needed to deal with other contexts such as research studies.</p>
